## Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Node.js:** Utilized for its asynchronous, event-driven architecture.
- **MongoDB:** Chosen for its flexibility with JSON-like documents and seamless integration with Node.js.

### MVC Architecture

- **Models:** Structured data storage represented by ProductModel, UserModel, and OrderModel.
- **Views:** API endpoints handling client requests.
- **Controllers:** Business logic encapsulated in controllers, promoting separation of concerns.

### Authentication and Authorization

- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) employed for secure user access.
- Registration, login, and profile management handled with JWT tokens.

### Database Design

- MongoDB collections designed to capture relationships:
  - Product: Represents product information, including reviews and ratings.
  - User: Stores user data with hashed passwords.
  - Order: Captures order details and references users and products.

### Error Handling and Validation

- Validation middleware ensures data integrity.
- Centralized error handling to provide consistent and informative responses.

### Additional Considerations

- Scalability designed with potential future growth and increased traffic in mind.
- Security best practices implemented for secure data storage, transmission, and user authentication.
